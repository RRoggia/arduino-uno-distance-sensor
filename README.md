# Arduino Uno Distance Sensor
Arduino uno project with a distance sensor

### Libraries Required 
* [Ultrasonic](https://github.com/JRodrigoTech/Ultrasonic-HC-SR04)

#### This project is splited in two parts:

1 - Distance Sensor implementation    
2 - LEDs reaction to the distance

#### The implemantation is splitted in two branchs:
* [`distance-sensor`](https://github.com/RRoggia/arduino-uno-distance-sensor/tree/distance-sensor)
* [`led-reaction`](https://github.com/RRoggia/arduino-uno-distance-sensor/tree/led-reaction)

#### Components used:
* 1 Arduino Uno
* 1 Distance Sensor 
* 1 Red LED
* 1 Yellow LED
* 1 Green LED
* 3 Resistors 1K 
* 12 Wires
* 1 Protoboard

# Distance Sensor Implementation 
Below there is the diagram to the distance sensor

Once you deployed the code to the arduino in the Serial Monitor (CTRL + SHIFT+ M) you will have something similar to that:

# Distance Sensor plus LEDs reacting to the distance
